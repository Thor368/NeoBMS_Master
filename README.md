# NeoBMS_Master

This is the Firmware of the NeoBMS Master. Watch out for these config files:

/inc/Battery_config_example.h
/src/Battery_config_example.c.bak

You need to edit them to suit your Battery und BMS configuration. After that rename them to:

/inc/Battery_config.h
/src/Battery_config.c

Otherwise the project will not compile.
